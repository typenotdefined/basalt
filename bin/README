======= Basalt Binary Modules =======
This is the source code for the C binary modules for the Basalt Roleplaying framework.

The main target is the 64x Linux server installation.

======= wrapper =======
This serves as a base for creating binary modules in ANSI C and is to be included in all subsequent modules.
The original repository had premake5.lua, I made it to use the Makefile system because I don't know premake.
Check the provided README for more informations.

======= How to add your module =======
Simply add your module name in the Makefile in the 'Module Registration' section and include needed headers!
All modules are built and placed in the ./build directory.
